# sqlalchemy-challenge

I used the following website:

geeksforgeeks.org/python-sqlalchemy-func-count-with-filter/ 

to help with finding the counts of stations. It is in the second cell of my code after the "exploratory data analysis" heading in my climate_starter notebook. The cell has a run count of 14, and the code is in lines 4-10. This code was also copied into the app.py in lines 112 to 118.

The app.py is the file that is to be used to start the api, and the climate_starter notebook contains the rest of the code.
